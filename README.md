# NUS-GDG-Unity-First-Game

Learning Unity for the First Time. This will be a text based RPG game to learn the mechanics
of Unity (2D). 

Key Notes
1) Do not make any changes in play mode since Unity will not save anything! 
2) You must add the scene you want to in build settings. 
3) In the build setting, the topmost one is the scene you will start from.
